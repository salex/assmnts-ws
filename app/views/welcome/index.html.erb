  <h5> Recent changes (since Cristmas)</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>I did an end to end import from 4D just using web services on all job stages that had on-line applications (no conversion files from 4D). 
      I only imported users from CSC, MFG and RYLA. I only imported scores from the CSC and RYLA. 
      MFG will dynamically load score from 4D if a profile is requested (and status starts
      with "conv."). 
    </li>

    <li>Password have been set to "please" for special users (admin, company,project)</li>

    <li>Javascript framework has been changed to jquery from prototype - pain, but seems a little easier. 
      Zipcode lookup implemented using a webservice at geonames.org
    </li>
    <li>Some basic changes made to assessments</li>

    <ul>
      <li>A Question.display_type set to None will basically NOP the question. It will not display on assessment, so won't be scored</li>
      <li>A Question.scored_method set to None will make the item not required and bypass client side validation.</li>
      <li>An Answer.value of 0 will not be required and bypass validation. Only useful on text/textform question when one of the answers is optional.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The company selection process, mainly to specific question search has been given helper screen that aids in creating complex queries.
      You still have to know what your are doing (ANDs and ORs and Groups)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <h5>What has been done to this point</h5>
  <p>A lot! I consider that functionally, the system is 95% complete (but that last 5% can be hell). 
    That is why I've really stopped now until I get some feedback. It will do all of what the current system does.
    <ul>
      <li>Create an manage assessments</li>
      <li>Publish jobs</li>
      <li>Collect and scores Applications</li>
      <li>Provides a selection process</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    What is left to do depends on how you want to proceed. Their is very little done in 4D, other than create/update citizen, 
    applicationData and citizen_stage records. 
    What goes in application data needs defined - applicant_id from rails and a form type is all that is really needed. It does do the basic 30 year
    old profile stuff and sticks something in xml, but why? 
    Again, once the applicant is pushed to 4D, 4D owns it and about the only thing you need from Rails 
    is the profile and there is a means to get that.
  </p>

  <h5>What is left to do</h5>
  <p>Decide if you want to proceed, or dwell on it for a couple more years!</p>
  <p>I understand the reluctance to use "Steve's" code again and the desire to
    create a newer and better approach. If that is what you want to do, I'll go away.
    I just wanted to finish what I couldn't complete - for various reasons.
  </p>
  <p>If you want to proceed, at least a little to evaluate what has been done, there
    needs to be some collaboration. The generic assessments was and is a great idea, 
    but if targeted to a more specific use, there are some things that can be improved.
    I don't want to define those by myself. The code is on github.
